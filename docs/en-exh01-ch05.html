ran along the Sotla River. For the most part, the new border matched the ethnic and old administrative border of previous state-political formations in that area, since the Sotla River had functioned as the national border between Slovenes and Croatians for centuries. In addition to the German border with Italy, this border on the Sotla River in the lower Štajerska region became the southernmost and protective border of the envisaged Thousand-Year Reich.</p><p id="OKPM-p-84">As was the case in all other occupiers’ borders in Slovene lands, the German administration also fenced in and secured its southern state border. Initial fortification works were finished by the late autumn of 1941. The Germans protected the border with barbed wire, minefields and border guardhouses placed in between; in March 1943, decrees on the urgent construction of watchtowers were issued. The wire, up to 2 metres tall, was placed on wooden posts that were evenly spaced along the riverbed every few metres. The minefield along the wire was about two to four metres wide.</p><p id="OKPM-p-85">It became very difficult and unpleasant to cross the border; moreover, it was possible only with a border pass. Due to a shortage of goods, the inhabitants, especially those living near the border, started smuggling goods across the border, thus illegally crossing it. From the Croatian side they carried tobacco and meat across the river, and in exchange their Slovene neighbours gave them salt, flour, sugar or coffee and even vitriol. They would also exchange bread, butter, milk, eggs, and important letters across the border.</p><p id="OKPM-p-86">In October 1944, Germans began large-scale fortification works along the entire border. They built firing trenches, machine-gun nests and bunkers, whose remnants are still clearly visible in the area today. They mobilised the local population, even those more than 20 kilometres away from the border, to perform heavy manual labour. After 1945, the atrocities of war were not yet over for the locals. The land mines that had been left behind along the Sotla River were the main cause of numerous casualties among the population, even many years after the war had ended.</p><figure id="figure-25-en"><img class="imageviewer" style="height:600px;" src="http://www2.sistory.si/publikacije/razstave/Okupacijske_meje/Pictures/exh01/exh01-Meje-pano5-image1-normal.jpg" data-high-res-src="http://www2.sistory.si/publikacije/razstave/Okupacijske_meje/Pictures/exh01/exh01-Meje-pano5-image1.jpg" alt="When Yugoslavia was occupied in 1941 and Slovenia was divided among Germany, Italy, Hungary and the NDH, the present-day Croatian Municipality of Hum na Sutli and its towns or hamlets of Hum, Lupinjak, Druškovec, Prišlin and Brezno was given to Germany. 6,530 (Croatian) inhabitants in an area of 36.85 square kilometres came under Germany's rule, while the annexed territory belonged to the Šmarje District based in Rogaška Slatina.
