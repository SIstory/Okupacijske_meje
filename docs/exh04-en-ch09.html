The school’s headmaster Feliks Jug wrote about 57 men and boys being taken. They were taken without a change of clothes or food. The conditions in the camps were unbearable and the prisoners were dying. Feliks Jug wrote that 17 prisoners out of 57 never returned. Nine children lost their fathers. Those who had returned from Rab spoke of the atrocities endured there.</p><p id="OKPM4-p-192">The children from Zilje attended school in Preloka. The occupiers did not harass schoolchildren. Lessons were held throughout the war years without any lengthy suspensions. The most shocking thing the children experienced was the death of their fathers or other relatives in camps. But the children themselves were also in danger when playing. When they were bathing in the Kolpa River, the Ustasha shot at them from across the river. Luckily, no one got hurt.</p><figure id="figure-127-en"><img class="imageviewer" style="height:600px;" src="http://www2.sistory.si/publikacije/razstave/Okupacijske_meje/Pictures/exh04/exh04-Meje-pano12-image1-normal.jpg" data-high-res-src="http://www2.sistory.si/publikacije/razstave/Okupacijske_meje/Pictures/exh04/exh04-Meje-pano12-image1.jpg" alt="Notes about the late Franc Čadonič, Jože Čadonič and Franc Čemas in a file kept by Nadškofijski arhiv Archiepiscopal Archives Ljubljana" /><figcaption>Notes about the late Franc Čadonič, Jože Čadonič and Franc Čemas in a file kept by Nadškofijski arhiv Archiepiscopal Archives Ljubljana</figcaption></figure><br /><br /><figure id="figure-128-en"><img class="imageviewer" style="height:600px;" src="http://www2.sistory.si/publikacije/razstave/Okupacijske_meje/Pictures/exh04/exh04-Meje-pano12-image2-normal.jpg" data-high-res-src="http://www2.sistory.si/publikacije/razstave/Okupacijske_meje/Pictures/exh04/exh04-Meje-pano12-image2.jpg" alt="Quite often, the internees were parents and their children.

However, it shows the pressure the children were under as they passed by different soldiers on their way to school. At the end of their native village they had to walk by Italians, but if they took a shortcut across the meadows and clearings, they might have run into partisans. The war turned those children's lives upside down. They were exposed to various dangers and obstacles. The children in the school in Preloka were in fact lucky. They successfully completed their schooling, despite the fact that their school-leaving certificates were issued by different countries.

In the 1942-1943 school year, her school-leaving certificate was issued by the Kingdom of Italy; in the next school year it was issued by the Government of the Free Territory; after the final year of the war, in the 1944-1945 school year, or more precisely in June 1945, she received a school-leaving certificate from the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia in her liberated homeland.
