The most fortified towns were: Metlika with 21 bunkers, Črnomelj with 64 bunkers and Semič with 11 bunkers. All those towns were entirely surrounded with barbed wire, which prevented people from passing through.</p><p id="OKPM4-p-164">Partisan informants collected as accurate information as possible about the enemy posts, forts and bunkers along the railway line in Bela krajina. They reported the number of soldiers, the units (»Royal Army, Financial Guard, Fascists, Carabinieri, Railway Militia, the White Guard«), the type of fortified buildings (bunkers, barbed wire), the type of armament, the movements of units away from their posts, and their supply. The intelligence service was performed by informants of the partisan units that were either permanently or temporarily active in Bela krajina.
