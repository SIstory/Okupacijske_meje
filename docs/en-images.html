                     Italy, Hungary and the NDH, the present-day Croatian Municipality of Hum na

                     was given to Germany. 6,530 (Croatian) inhabitants in an area of 36.85 square
                     kilometres came under Germany's rule, while the annexed territory belonged to
                     the Šmarje District based in Rogaška Slatina. The main reason behind the
                     annexation was industry – the glassworks Straža in Hum was highly advanced at
                     that time and connected with the Štajerska region. Its owner was German. Thus,
                     the border did not run along the Sotla River but along the banks of the
                     Hrvatsko Zagorje region. In the end of June, after being persuaded by the NDH,
                     this area was re-annexed to Croatia and the border was moved to the Sotla

                     heavily guarded its banks and enclosed it with barbed wire and minefields.
                     Nevertheless, smuggling soon emerged across the river. Most sought after
