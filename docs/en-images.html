                     was given to Germany. 6,530 (Croatian) inhabitants in an area of 36.85 square

                     the Šmarje District based in Rogaška Slatina. The main reason behind the
                     annexation was industry – the glassworks Straža in Hum was highly advanced at
                     that time and connected with the Štajerska region. Its owner was German. Thus,
                     the border did not run along the Sotla River but along the banks of the
                     Hrvatsko Zagorje region. In the end of June, after being persuaded by the NDH,
                     this area was re-annexed to Croatia and the border was moved to the Sotla

                     barbed wire and fortified with five concrete bunkers and three bunkers dug into
                     the ground, as well as with a stone and concrete wall. They also dug connecting
                     trenches. The partisan sketch and description of the Italian post in Griblje

                     1941 and it stayed there for about two months. Afterwards, on 2 April 1942,
                     members of the Financial Guard moved into two civilian houses, forcing the
                     owners and their families to leave, while the Fascists occupied the new school.
                     They enclosed the occupied buildings by barbed wire, built three bunkers and a
                     stone wall, and dug a firing trench. The villagers had to take part in the

                     from Semič, which was enclosed by barbed wire, and all were protected by
                     knife-rests. The church bell tower was used as an observation post, armed with
                     a heavy machine gun and mortar. According to a partisan report dated 13
                     February 1943, there were around 180 Italian soldiers and between 140 and 180

                     military material from the Balkan Peninsula towards Italy. The railway line was
                     protected by bunkers and by fortifying the railway stations and guardhouses.

                     them for the chickens they wanted for lunch, or for washing their linen and
                     clothing. Some of the Italian soldiers were said to have been Slovenes from the

                     uncomfortable that must have been for children to walk by soldiers, bunkers and
                     barbed wire obstacles every day. The story we heard from Frančiška Tahija
                     (maiden name Balkovec) about the greeting »Buongiorno«, which they were taught
                     by the Italians, and the greeting »Death to Fascism, freedom to the people«
                     they were taught by the partisans, may seem adorable. However, it shows the
                     pressure the children were under as they passed by different soldiers on their
                     way to school. At the end of their native village they had to walk by Italians,
                     but if they took a shortcut across the meadows and clearings, they might have
                     run into partisans. The war turned those children's lives upside down. They
                     were exposed to various dangers and obstacles. The children in the school in
                     Preloka were in fact lucky. They successfully completed their schooling,
                     despite the fact that their school-leaving certificates were issued by
                     different countries. The picture shows the school-leaving certificates of
                     Frančiška Tahija (maiden name Balkovec). In the 1942-1943 school year, her
                     school-leaving certificate was issued by the Kingdom of Italy; in the next
                     school year it was issued by the Government of the Free Territory; after the
                     final year of the war, in the 1944-1945 school year, or more precisely in June
                     1945, she received a school-leaving certificate from the Democratic Federal
                     Yugoslavia in her liberated homeland. Signed as the headmaster on all three
                     school-leaving certificates is Feliks Jug.</a></li><li><a href="exh04-en-ch09.html#figure-130-en">The letter sent by Jože Pokorn, a parish priest in Preloka, to Škofijski
                     ordinariat (Episcopal Ordinariat) in Ljubljana. In the letter he points out,
                     among other things, the great distress of family members who are unable to send
                     packages to the internees and who do not know whether they are even alive.

                     read the names of the deceased during mass; various witnesses have corroborated
                     this. According to Angela Žugelj, Birička fainted. Birička is Frančiška Čadonič
                     (maiden name Erdeljac). The parish priest read from the pulpit that her son
                     Franc and brother-in-law Jože had died. Author: Božidar Flajšman.</a></li></ul></section></div><script type="text/javascript">
