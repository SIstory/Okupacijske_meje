It is situated roughly halfway between Vinica and Preloka. Before World War II, the seat of the municipality was located in Vinica, while the seat of the parish was in Preloka. At the start of World War II, around 250 people were living in the village. The villages of Preloka and Vinica were only slightly bigger. Zilje is situated from 233 to 300 metres above sea level, while the Kolpa River is situated at 153 metres. At the start of World War II, the villagers were engaged in farming. A tier 2 banate road ran through the village from Vinica to Adlešiči. The Succursal Church of St Anton was situated at the highest point in the settlement. The local church held mass only on special occasions.</p><p id="OKPM4-p-187">At the start of World War II, Italians came to the village. First, the Fascists set up a post in the village, then came the Financial Guard. In the autumn of 1942, they were joined by common soldiers. They fortified the houses, which they had occupied beforehand, built bunkers and protected it all with a ring of barbed wire.</p><p id="OKPM4-p-188">Partisans did not attack the post also because of warnings received from the villagers that the garrison was not making any threats, but if an attack occurred, they might exact revenge. In the summer of 1942, the circumstances changed. During the offensive the Italians began making mass arrests and sending civilian population to concentration camps. The inhabitants of the Preloka parish were banished to a camp in early August 1942.</p><p id="OKPM4-p-189">In 1913, Marko Čadonič from the village of Balkovci and Frančiška Erdeljac from the Croatian village of Prilišče went to America. They met each other there and got married in 1916.</p><p id="OKPM4-p-190">In 1917, 1918 and 1919, their children Marko, Marija and Franc were born. In the spring of 1920, the young family returned to Balkovci. Somewhat later, the father returned to the USA, where he died before World War II started. In Marko's native village, a son named Jože was born to his father in 1917. The boys grew up and by the time World War II started they were grown men.</p><figure id="figure-121-en"><img class="imageviewer" style="height:600px;" src="http://www2.sistory.si/publikacije/razstave/Okupacijske_meje/Pictures/exh04/exh04-Meje-pano11-image1-normal.jpg" data-high-res-src="http://www2.sistory.si/publikacije/razstave/Okupacijske_meje/Pictures/exh04/exh04-Meje-pano11-image1.jpg" alt="Zilje" /><figcaption>Zilje</figcaption></figure><br /><br /><figure id="figure-122-en"><img class="imageviewer" style="height:600px;" src="http://www2.sistory.si/publikacije/razstave/Okupacijske_meje/Pictures/exh04/exh04-Meje-pano11-image2-normal.jpg" data-high-res-src="http://www2.sistory.si/publikacije/razstave/Okupacijske_meje/Pictures/exh04/exh04-Meje-pano11-image2.jpg" alt="In the autumn of 1942, three houses were evacuated in Dolnje Zilje and the residents had to stay with their neighbours.
